steel shapeoko2
===============

Big Shapeoko made by steel tubes and OpenRail.

In my country isn't easy to amateur materials like openslide or other aluminium railed frames. If you buy something like shapeoko or makerslide to the USA, you have to pay a lot of custom clearance costs.

I've tied made an opensource big CNC (Soft materials), ussing the existing open projects as Shapeoko and RepRap.
